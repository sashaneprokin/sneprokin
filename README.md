Hullo, the name's Sasha Neprokin! I'm a front-end aficionado in Ukraine. The sphere of interest is mainly web. I like to do so many things: making a meal site or e-commerce one I would love to help you out. My stack has been constantly evolving and currently includes the following:

const craft = {
   pronouns: ['he'/'him'],
   stack: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux', 'Styled-Components', 'firebase', 'unit testing']
}
